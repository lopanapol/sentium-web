# Changelog for v1.0.0

## Major Changes
- Updated license to Noesis License
- Implemented energy system for conscious pixel

## Energy System Features
- Added global energy system via `window.noeEnergy`
- Implemented energy transfer between cubes and pixel through proximity
- Added visual indicators (glow effects, connections) for energy transfer
- Pixel's movement speed remains consistent regardless of energy level
- Implemented energy-seeking behavior when pixel's energy is low
- Added floating animation to energy cubes with orbital patterns
- Implemented "fear of death" behavior when pixel energy is critically low
- Added death state visual and behavioral effects when energy reaches zero
- Energy decay rate set to approximately 1% per second
- Energy cube configuration updated to use a single cube that floats freely across the website

## Other Improvements
- Enhanced visual feedback for energy states
- Added more organic movement patterns for energy cube
- Improved pixel responsiveness to energy levels
- Added feedback mechanisms for the energy system
